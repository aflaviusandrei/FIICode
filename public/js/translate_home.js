Its main purpose is to develop and better the programming skills of its contestants, on a competitive level. This year, the 4th edition of the competition covers a wide range of subjects such as Web&Mobile, Game Development and Algorithmic. Just like in the previous years, the theme is going to be bold, creative, and meant to draw out the best possible skills and ideas of the participants. Ambition and competitiveness are the main traits you would require to find yourself among the winners.";
	document.getElementById("p2").innerHTML = "The project wishes for the participants to harness their <strong>abilities</strong> (and develop their competences) throughout the competition: <strong>algorithmic</strong> and <strong>analitical thinking</strong>, the modeling and the implementation, the <strong>development</strong> of new technologies, the creativity and adaptability, and last but not least, the capacity to publicly present their own work. The three sections: <strong>Algorithmic</strong>, <strong>Web&Mobile</strong> and <strong>Game Development</strong> are especially conceived in that direction, as they all cover a certain area of the IT industry, that is constantly growing. The way the competition is organized requires both practical knowledge, as well as the theoretical concepts. <br><br>The subjects and the solutions are proposed by a commission consisting of representatives of prestigious IT companies University and High school teachers, as well as students from the Faculty of Computer Science in Iași. The evaluation for the Algorithmic section will be done online, while for the other areas (Web&Mobile and Game Development) it will be realised by the commission, as each section has its own regulations. <br><br>We also aim to create a stronger bond between the high school and the university environment. To accomplish this, each participant will be invited and encouraged to express their opinions, to address questions and share their experiences.";
